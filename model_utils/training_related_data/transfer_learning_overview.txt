The values are only an idea, the point here is to have the points in mind.


Things to define:
    Aim:
        mAP > 75% (that’s enough)

    Classes:
        Car, Pedestrian, Tree, Traffic light, school

    Data:
        Which conditions (light, etc.)?
        Normal drive without (specific) objects
        Static recording with different objects in different orientations and positions ‘in front’ of camera
        Image number (Everyone could annotate 100 images à 500 images overall) 
    
    Annotation guideline 
        How much of an object must be visible to be considered as an object?
        Assume 10 person directly next to each other: One person or several?

    Additional definitions:
        Different training strategies? (Batch size, epochs, stop criteria, data splits, etc.)
        Data augmentation and preprocessing?


Procedure:
    Record images
    Annotate images
    Create dataset
    Train model
    Test model in real world
    Iterate process, if still necessary
